# Nexter - CSS Grid Layout Practice

Real estate landing page built to practice CSS Grid techniques.

## Grid Features Used

- **Named grid lines and areas** for layout structure
- **Complex grid spanning** with `grid-column: full-start / col-end 6` 
- **Responsive grid adjustments** using `minmax()` and `fr` units
- **Overlapping items** in the image gallery section
- **Grid template definitions** for precise row/column control

## Notes

Solid practice with Grid's layout capabilities. Clean way to handle complex responsive designs without the usual CSS gymnastics. Named grid lines make the code readable.

Used Sass mainly for file organization - most of its features are now native CSS anyway.

**Stack**: HTML, Sass, CSS Grid
